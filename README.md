## Anime Quick Search

Anime Quick Search is an application for performing quick searches of anime titles from a MyAnimeList API called [Jikan](https://jikan.moe/)

## Usage

The web application is pretty simple, providing a search bar for input and an option to clear searches. The application sends requests to the API and then populates the page with results. Information from the API is used alongside images to display searches.

Search bar should be displayed top center of search and takes text input.

After searching anime should popluate in the form of a list. Each anime will have an image, title, and a more info button that will display number of episodes and the year the anime aired.

Mousing over to images display the synopisis for each that follows to the screen to keep up with scrolling.

## Later Contributions

Would like to further improve CSS styling to make page even more contemporary. One piece of functionality missing is the ability to to not return an anime that is already searched. Will fins solutin in the future.
