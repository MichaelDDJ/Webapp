##Anime Quick Search
Anime Quick Search is an application for performing quick searches of anime titles from a MyAnimeList API called [Jikan](https://jikan.moe/)
##Usage
The web application is pretty simple, providing a search bar for input and an option to clear searches. The application sends requests to the API and then populates the page with results. Information from the API is used alongside images to display searches.
